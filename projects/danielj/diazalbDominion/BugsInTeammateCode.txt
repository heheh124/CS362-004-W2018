•	Cardtest1—Smithy
o	Unique Bug Name: SmithyBug1
o	Bug found: There is a failure in one of the tests which results in “hand count ‘3’ failed”.  This means that the current hand count is not equal to 3 after playing Smithy. 
o	Test description: tests if the current hand count is 3.  If not, test will fail.
o	Severity: Major
o	Priority: High
o	Bug cause: The smithyCard function has a for loop function that will only give up to 2 cards instead of 3.  I found the bug while running cardtest1.  The bug is from the following code within the smithyCard function:
